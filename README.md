# The-Cube

This project demonstrates a simple interactive 3D cube rendered using Three.js, a popular JavaScript 3D library. The cube can be rotated and viewed from different angles, providing a basic introduction to 3D graphics on the web.
## Features

- 3D Cube Rendering: Displays a colored cube in a web browser using WebGL via Three.js.
- User Interaction: Allows users to rotate the cube with mouse or touch controls.
- Customizable Appearance: Easily modify cube size, color, and rotation speed in the code.
- Responsive Canvas: The 3D scene automatically resizes to fit the browser window.

## How It Works

Three.js Scene Setup: Initializes a scene, camera, and renderer.
Cube Geometry: Creates a box geometry and applies a basic material.
Animation Loop: Continuously renders the scene and updates the cube's rotation.
Controls: Optionally includes orbit controls for interactive rotation.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository.
Open index.html in your browser.
Interact with the cube using your mouse or touch.
